					<p>Born in the 80s in Shanghai, Lin An Qi has always been struggling to pull out the substance of his own life and chasing for independence by doing little break-through the tradition.</p>
					<p>In the 90s, Lin An Qi became the student of a young but talented artist, Gang Cao, who brought him into the art world. He not only taught him various painting skills but also the way to feel and observe life. </p>
					<p>In 2002, Lin An Qi majored in Souvenir Design from the Shanghai Arts & Crafts College. During that period, he already was rewarded with many honors and his art pieces had been collected by his school while his hand made wooden Toy called “ Duck” was released in the “Hand crafts” Magazine. </p>
					<p>From 2004 to 2008, Lin An Qi was recruited by the Shanghai Normal University of Fine Arts, and finally majored in Visual Communication.</p>
					<p>During that last period, he participated to many art events. In particular in 2005, he participated to the joint Exhibition of the Xuhui Government for the Long Hua Art Fair “ Opening”, an interactive installation exhibition set up outside of Long Hua Temple Plaza. In 2007, he participated in the Workshop Project organized by “Gert Dumbar”.</p>
					<p>At Christmas 2009, one eye of Lin An Qi was damaged, thus changing his perception of reality and his “vision” of the world. It so became a new way to question again the substance of life. One eye to see the external world, one eye to see the inner world.perception of reality and his “vision” of the world. It so became a new way to question again the substance of life. One eye to see the external world, one eye to see the inner world.</p>
